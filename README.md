#### About
A simple gruvified spotify theme. 

#### First Aid Kit  ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

- Tested on macOS only and pretty much everything worked. 
- Just in case, if the icons/fonts doesn't change or broke(mostly for other untested platforms), then try to replace the `spoticon_xxx` font file in your `glue-resources` folder with this [spoticon_xxx](./assets/glue-resources/fonts/spoticon_cb67241fb50eae02396ee4647eb9a2e6.ttf) font file. 
- In macOS it is `/Applications/Spotify.app/Contents/Resources/Apps/glue-resources/` I'm sure you can find your's ﾍ(･_|

#### On my list
